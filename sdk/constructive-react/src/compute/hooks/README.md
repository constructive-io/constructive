## Setup

```typescript
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { configure } from './hooks';

configure({
  endpoint: 'https://api.example.com/graphql',
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer <token>' },
});

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <YourApp />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
