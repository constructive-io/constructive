/**
 * admission — the two in-process bounds that decide whether a request is
 * allowed to start at all.
 *
 * `request-protection` resolves the numbers; this module is what spends them.
 * The three GUCs it hands to PostgreSQL bound how *long* one request may run,
 * which is a different question from how *many* may run at once: fifty legal
 * 20-second queries saturate the pool that serves every other tenant on the
 * replica without any single one of them misbehaving. So there are two bounds
 * here, and they protect different things:
 *
 *   - {@link ConcurrencyLimiter} bounds width per tenant. The resource being
 *     protected is *this process's* PostgreSQL pool, so the counter is
 *     deliberately in-process and `maxConcurrentRequests` is a per-replica
 *     budget. Coordinating it cluster-wide would need shared state on the hot
 *     path to bound something that is not shared.
 *
 *   - {@link RateWindow} bounds one caller's rate. A tenant-wide rate limit
 *     cannot answer abuse on a public API: the tenant's own budget is what an
 *     anonymous flood spends, so exhausting it turns the tenant's site off on
 *     the attacker's behalf. The per-caller bound is therefore keyed on the
 *     only discriminator an anonymous request has, and it fails closed —
 *     unlike a billing quota, which serves and records overage.
 *
 * Neither touches the database. A limiter that needs a row lock to decide
 * whether to admit a request has made the saturation it exists to prevent
 * cheaper to cause.
