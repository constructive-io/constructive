/**
 * LOG-ONLY DEPLOYMENT USE CASE & SETUP
 * 
 * Log-only deployment is used when you have an existing database that already contains
 * schema changes, but you want to start using pgpm for future migrations.
 * 
 * What it does:
 * - Records deployment metadata in the migration tracking tables
 * - Does NOT actually execute the SQL scripts
 * - Marks changes as "deployed" without running them
 * 
 * When to use:
 * - Converting an existing database to use pgpm
 * - The database already has schema objects that match your migration scripts
 * - You need to "catch up" the migration history without re-creating existing objects
 * 
 * Setup process for existing database:
 * 1. Install launchql and setup launchql directory structure
 * 2. Dump your existing schema into initial migration files
 * 3. Create and tag your migrations (e.g., as v1)
 * 4. Run your FIRST deployment with --log-only flag against existing database
 *    - This records the migrations as deployed without executing them
 * 5. Future deployments can run normally (without --log-only)
