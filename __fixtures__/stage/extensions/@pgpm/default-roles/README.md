Default PostgreSQL role definitions and permissions.

## Overview

`@pgpm/default-roles` provides a standardized role hierarchy for PostgreSQL applications. This package creates three fundamental roles (anonymous, authenticated, administrator) that form the foundation for role-based access control (RBAC) in your database. These roles are designed to work with JWT-based authentication and row-level security policies.

## Features

- **Three-Tier Role Hierarchy**: anonymous → authenticated → administrator
- **Secure Defaults**: Roles created with minimal privileges
- **RLS Integration**: Administrator role can bypass RLS, others cannot
- **Idempotent Creation**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Standard Permissions**: Consistent role configuration across applications

## Installation

If you have `pgpm` installed:

```bash
pgpm install @pgpm/default-roles
pgpm deploy
```

This is a quick way to get started. The sections below provide more detailed installation options.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install pgpm CLI 
npm install -g pgpm

# Start local Postgres (via Docker) and export env vars
pgpm docker start
eval "$(pgpm env)"
```

> **Tip:** Already running Postgres? Skip the Docker step and just export your `PG*` environment variables.

### **Add to an Existing Package**

```bash
# 1. Install the package
pgpm install @pgpm/default-roles

# 2. Deploy locally
pgpm deploy 
```

### **Add to a New Project**

```bash
# 1. Create a workspace
pgpm init workspace

# 2. Create your first module
cd my-workspace
pgpm init

# 3. Install a package
cd packages/my-module
pgpm install @pgpm/default-roles

# 4. Deploy everything
pgpm deploy --createdb --database mydb1
```

## Roles

### anonymous
The most restrictive role for unauthenticated users.

**Permissions:**
- NOCREATEDB: Cannot create databases
- NOCREATEROLE: Cannot create roles
- NOLOGIN: Cannot log in directly
- NOBYPASSRLS: Must respect row-level security

**Use Cases:**
- Public API endpoints
- Unauthenticated read access
- Public data queries

### authenticated
Role for logged-in users with verified identity.

**Permissions:**
- NOCREATEDB: Cannot create databases
- NOCREATEROLE: Cannot create roles
- NOLOGIN: Cannot log in directly (uses JWT)
- NOBYPASSRLS: Must respect row-level security

**Use Cases:**
- Logged-in user operations
- User-specific data access
- Protected endpoints

### administrator
Elevated role with administrative privileges.

**Permissions:**
- NOCREATEDB: Cannot create databases
- NOCREATEROLE: Cannot create roles
- NOLOGIN: Cannot log in directly (uses JWT)
- BYPASSRLS: Can bypass row-level security
- Inherits: anonymous, authenticated

**Use Cases:**
- Administrative operations
- System maintenance
- Data management tasks

## Usage

### Setting Up Roles

The roles are automatically created when you deploy this package:

```bash
pgpm deploy @pgpm/default-roles
```

### Using Roles with JWT

Set the PostgreSQL role based on JWT claims:

```sql
-- In your authentication function
SET LOCAL ROLE anonymous;  -- For unauthenticated requests
SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;  -- For logged-in users
SET LOCAL ROLE administrator;  -- For admin users
```

### Granting Table Permissions

```sql
-- Grant read access to anonymous users
GRANT SELECT ON my_table TO anonymous;

-- Grant full access to authenticated users
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON my_table TO authenticated;

-- Grant all privileges to administrators
GRANT ALL ON my_table TO administrator;
```

### Row-Level Security Policies

```sql
-- Enable RLS on a table
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Anonymous can only see public profiles
CREATE POLICY anonymous_users ON users
  FOR SELECT
  TO anonymous
  USING (is_public = true);

-- Authenticated users can see their own data
CREATE POLICY authenticated_users ON users
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (id = jwt_public.current_user_id());

-- Administrators bypass RLS automatically (BYPASSRLS privilege)
```

### Role Hierarchy Example

```sql
-- Create a custom role that inherits authenticated
CREATE ROLE moderator;
GRANT authenticated TO moderator;
ALTER USER moderator WITH BYPASSRLS;  -- Moderators can bypass RLS

-- Grant moderator additional permissions
GRANT DELETE ON comments TO moderator;
```

## Integration with Other Packages

### With @pgpm/jwt-claims

```sql
-- Use JWT claims to determine role
CREATE FUNCTION set_user_role() RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
  user_role text;
BEGIN
  user_role := current_setting('jwt.claims.role', true);
  
  IF user_role = 'admin' THEN
    SET LOCAL ROLE administrator;
  ELSIF user_role = 'user' THEN
    SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;
  ELSE
    SET LOCAL ROLE anonymous;
  END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### With @pgpm/jobs

```sql
-- Grant job management to administrators
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_jobs.jobs TO administrator;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION app_jobs.add_job TO authenticated;
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never grant SUPERUSER**: These roles intentionally lack superuser privileges
2. **Use RLS policies**: Combine roles with row-level security for fine-grained access control
3. **Principle of least privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to each role
4. **Audit role usage**: Monitor which roles are being used in your application
5. **JWT integration**: Always validate JWT claims before setting roles

## Dependencies

- `@pgpm/verify`: Verification utilities
