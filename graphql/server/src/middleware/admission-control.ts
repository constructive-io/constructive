/**
 * admission-control — the gate that decides whether a GraphQL request starts.
 *
 * The document gate rejects a *shape* and the timeout GUCs bound a *duration*;
 * neither refuses a request that is individually reasonable. This does, on two
 * axes:
 *
 *   1. **Concurrency**, per database. The thing being protected is this
 *      process's PostgreSQL pool, so the counter is in-process and
 *      `maxConcurrentRequests` is a per-replica budget — a cluster-wide number
 *      would need shared state on the hot path to bound something that is not
 *      shared. Over budget, a request waits up to `maxQueueWaitMs` for a slot
 *      and is then refused; it never queues unbounded, because a queue that
 *      outgrows the timeout is just latency with a memory cost.
 *
 *   2. **Rate**, per caller per route. Keyed on the client address rather than
 *      the tenant, because a tenant-wide limit is spent *by* an anonymous
 *      flood: exhausting it takes the tenant's own API down on the attacker's
 *      behalf. This is abuse protection and fails closed, which is the opposite
 *      of a billing quota (that serves and records overage) — the two must not
 *      be conflated, and neither is a database write on the request path.
 *
