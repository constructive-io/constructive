**Constructive** is a complete ecosystem for modular PostgreSQL development. Design your database schema, manage it with our package manager, and get a production-ready GraphQL API automatically. Build composable database modules, version them like npm packages, and deploy with confidence.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install & Setup

```bash
# Install pgpm globally
npm install -g pgpm

# Start local Postgres (via Docker) and export env vars
pgpm docker start
eval "$(pgpm env)"
```

> **Tip:** Already running Postgres? Skip the Docker step and just export your PG* vars.

## What is Constructive?

Constructive transforms how you build PostgreSQL applications by treating your database as a modular, version-controlled system. At its core is **pgpm** (PostgreSQL Package Manager), which brings npm-style package management to Postgres. Write SQL migrations, organize them into reusable modules, install database packages as dependencies, and deploy with deterministic, plan-driven migrations.

The framework automatically generates a secure, role-aware GraphQL API from your PostgreSQL schema using PostGraphile. This means you design your database once, and Constructive handles the API layer, authentication middleware, and developer tooling.

### Core Philosophy

Constructive embraces a database-first development approach where your PostgreSQL schema is the source of truth. Row-Level Security (RLS) policies become your authorization layer, database functions become your business logic, and the GraphQL API is automatically derived from your carefully designed schema. This eliminates the impedance mismatch between your database and API while giving you the full power of SQL.

## Key Components

  const result = await db.query('SELECT current_user_id()');
  expect(result.rows[0].current_user_id).toBe('123');
});
```

## Why Constructive?

**Modular by Design** - Organize your database into reusable packages with clear dependencies. Share common schemas across projects, version them independently, and compose complex systems from simple building blocks.

**Database-First Development** - Your PostgreSQL schema is the source of truth. Design your data model with the full power of SQL, leverage Row-Level Security for authorization, and let Constructive generate your API automatically.

**Production-Ready** - Built for teams shipping real applications. Deterministic migrations, comprehensive testing tools, automatic API generation, and deployment automation mean you can move fast without breaking things.

**Developer Experience** - Hot-reload development server, GraphiQL explorer, automatic TypeScript types, and comprehensive testing utilities make building PostgreSQL applications a joy.

## Architecture

Constructive applications follow a clear architecture:

1. **Database Layer** - PostgreSQL schemas with tables, functions, views, and RLS policies organized into modules
2. **Migration Layer** - pgpm manages schema changes with version-controlled, plan-driven deployments
3. **API Layer** - PostGraphile automatically generates a GraphQL API respecting your RLS policies
4. **Client Layer** - Auto-generated TypeScript types and query builders for type-safe client development

This architecture eliminates the traditional ORM layer and API boilerplate, letting you focus on your data model and business logic.
