/**
 * The managed upload lifecycle, shared by both transports.
 *
 * Multipart-through-GraphQL and presigned two-step are transports for one
 * lifecycle, not two data models: either way an object gets a files row, a
 * server-chosen key, a tenant-resolved bucket, and a projection document that
 * carries the files row's id. The only difference is who moves the bytes.
 *
 * This module owns the parts that are the same:
 *   * `resolveManagedUploadTarget` — from a document column to a concrete
 *     (storage module, bucket, physical bucket, S3 config).
 *   * `finalizeStagedUpload` — from bytes already in S3 under a staging key to a
 *     files row and a projection document, deduplicating on content hash.
 *   * `buildFileProjection` — the document shape the column stores.
 *
 * Nothing here bakes a presigned URL into a row: `url` is populated only for a
 * public bucket, where it is a stable CDN address rather than a credential with
 * an expiry.
