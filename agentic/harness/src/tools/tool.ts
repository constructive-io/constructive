 * `ToolDefinition`), the arguments its runner threads through `execute`, and
 * its terminal rendering. None of that is a property of the tool itself: what
 * `add_records` *is* is a name, a description the model reads, a parameter
 * shape, and a function from validated params to text plus structured details.
 *
 * So that is all this states. An adapter maps it onto its own runner
 * (`toPiTool` in `@agentic-kit/pi`), which is the only place a tool's
