// The machine transport wire protocol: JSON text frames over a WebSocket. Two
// socket roles speak it — a runner (the daemon on the user's machine) and a
// client (whatever is driving a session) — with the relay in the middle routing
// frames between them by session id.
//
// The relay never interprets terminal bytes: `input` flows client → runner,
// `output` flows runner → client, both opaque UTF-8 strings. Everything else
// is session lifecycle.
//
// Phase 2 adds the rest of a terminal — `resize`, `signal`, `detach`,
// `reattach` — as frames on this same socket rather than a second transport.
// Each is an *operation*, not a routing hint: the relay answers every one of
// them by asking the tenant's SQL again, so a frame here is a request and never
// a decision. That is what makes a reattach from a different client safe —
// nothing about the attach that opened the session carries over.
//
// Two vocabularies live here, and the line between them is the line between the
// runner and everything above it:
//
// - The *machine* frames (`open` … `exit`, plus enrollment) are the remote
//   control. A runner speaks only these: it runs an allow-listed command in a
//   pty or on pipes, moves bytes, reports the exit. It has no notion of what the
//   command is.
// - The *agent* vocabulary (`AgentBinding` on an `open`, `AgentEvent`, the
//   `agent_event` frame, the stdio contract below) is between a client, the
//   relay and an agent program running *under* the runner. The runner never
//   reads or writes any of it; to the runner an agent program is a command on
//   pipes whose stdout happens to be JSON lines.
//
// This package is vocabulary, never policy. Everything a socket puts on the wire
// — its database, its machine id — is a *coordinate*: it says which row the
// socket is asking about, and the relay answers by asking that database's SQL.
// Nothing here grants anything and no frame carries an authorization decision,
// so naming a coordinate buys nothing: a secret only matches a machine row in
// the tenant that issued it, and RLS decides everything after that. Addressing a
// database you have no credential for is simply a refusal.

// Token hashing is deliberately NOT re-exported here: it needs node's `crypto`,
// and this index is imported by the browser terminal. Node consumers reach it at
// `@constructive-db/machine-protocol/token`.

/**
